# Gesture-Control-Car
The Gesture Controlled Car uses hand gestures to control a car's movement. Through a motion sensor or camera, gestures like forward, backward, left, and right are detected and wirelessly transmitted to the car. It offers an intuitive, hands-free control experience with real-time feedback via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
